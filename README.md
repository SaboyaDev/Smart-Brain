## About

 A Facial Recognition app built on React.js that uses Clarifai API to detect a face on a photo. A user can sign-up or login securely, and the system will keep track of how many scans the user has.

The backend was built on Node.js with an Express server that connects to a MySQL database. For security BCrypt was implemented, this took care of the password-hashing.
